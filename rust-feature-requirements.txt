For this project to work in RUST with relative ease, we need libraries for the following features:
* Creating TLS connections | DONE
* Choose root store used | DONE
* Support TLS 1.0-1.3 | DONE
* Validate certificates on the fly | DONE

  Use the openssl create, specifically the ssl module.

  SslConnectorBuilder allows you to specify a custom certificate verification.
  Allows you to set a custom X509 store.

  Since this module is a binding to OpenSSL, it should have all the required features.
  It supports TLS, choose root store, can validate certificates, even custom method.

  Information we need for analysis:
  * Domain
  * IP Address
  * TLSVersion
  * Certificate chain
  * Is cert chain valid?
  *
